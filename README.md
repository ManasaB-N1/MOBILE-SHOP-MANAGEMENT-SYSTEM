We accumulated all the requisites by studying the existing system we have analyzed the system in terms of the task it is performing and the types of users utilizing the system.
         In today’s market, retailers and wholesale outlets should quickly adapt to the ever Changing technology to minimize overhead, lower cost of operation, and help to stay competative. Everybody needs software, which can facilitate Store operations and make their day-to-day lives much easier. Mobile Shop Management System is application software designed to take advantage of today ’s technology and reduce or avoid the burden of storing data on paper and in files. This facilitates moving purchase, sales, and customer information, as well as supplier and company data, from paper to digital media on a secured server. Sales and purchase bills can be generated as needed.
    The Mobile Shop Management System is software which can become the backbone for A billing and inventory system for small organizations. This software provides an uncomplicated system to run mobile shops. It will provide an easy and attractive Interface so that the user can easily manage and utilize the application. This application is designed in a way that it will only require a minimum amount of information from the user. The goal was to look for the minimum amount of information that will meet needed requirements. 
   The Mobile Shop Management System is developed for systems to facilitate mobile shop owner’s management of customer details and inventory data, which will include Mobile phones. It can be used efficiently for physically separated shops in different locations. This software will provide in a simple and easy to operate User interface, which can be managed by any user without having prior in depth Knowledge of the computer system. Administrators can pull data, from any location from the server. It will be useful when ordering new purchases to avoid overstocking. This software is a complete package for small organizations which will allow them to keep track of their sales and inventory, and provide a computerized billing system.
 The system administrator will have complete access to the system configuration and Data and for this he has to login using his admin id and password. The Admin has Options to add or remove phones, and can also keep track of their stocks. The Mobile Shop Management System is a secure application, and a user needs to enter the proper combination of Username and Password to access application. Currently this application has multiple users with user -wise limitation and access control. Every user has to initially sign up and create an account of their own. This includes the generation of a user id which they should use for logging in along with the user defined password. Every user also has an option to update or edit their details such as phone number, email id and address.

A bill will be generated for the purchase after the order is confirmed and the customer is asked for their feedback and then the response is recorded.
 
REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION

2.1 Hardware requirements:
System requirements are the configuration that a system must have in order for a hardware or software application to run smoothly and efficiently. Failure to meet these requirements can result in installation problems or performance problems. The former may prevent a device or application from getting installed, whereas the latter may cause a product to malfunction or perform below expectation or even to hang or crash.

System requirements are also known as minimum system requirements.
To be used efficiently, all computer software needs certain hardware components or other software resources to be present on a computer. These prerequisites are known as (computer) system requirements and are often used as a guideline as opposed to an absolute rule.

 Most software defines two sets of system requirements: minimum and recommended. With increasing demand for higher processing power and resources in newer versions of software, system requirements tend to increase over time. Industry analysts suggest that this trend plays a bigger part in driving upgrades to existing computer systems than technological advancements. A second meaning of the term of system requirements, is a generalization of this first definition, giving the requirements to be met in the design of a system or sub-system.


Processor: Intel core processor
RAM:  512 MB and above
Hard-disc: 2 GB and above
 


 2.2 Software requirements:

Software requirements deal with defining software resource requirements and prerequisites that need to be installed on a computer to provide optimal functioning of an application. These requirements or prerequisites are generally not included in the software installation package and need to be installed separately before the software is installed.

A computing platform describes some sort of framework, either in hardware or software, which allows software to run. Typical platforms include a computer's architecture, operating system, or programming languages and their runtime libraries.
Operating system is one of the requirements mentioned when defining system requirements (software). Software may not be compatible with different versions of same line of operating systems, although some measure of backward compatibility is often maintained. 

For example, most software designed for Microsoft Windows XP does not run on Microsoft Windows 98, although the converse is not always true. Similarly, software designed using newer features of Linux Kernel v2.6 generally does not run or compile properly (or at all) on Linux distributions using Kernel v2.2 or v2.4.

Software making extensive use of special hardware devices, like high-end display adapters, needs special API or newer device drivers. A good example is DirectX, which is a collection of APIs for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming, on Microsoft platforms.
